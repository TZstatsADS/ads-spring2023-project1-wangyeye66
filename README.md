### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2023

+ Projec title: EDA on what philosophers said
+ This project is conducted by Han Wang

+ Project summary: This small project is mainly focus on data visualization and text mining. I used **matplotlib** and **seaborn** package for data visualiaztion and then used **nltk** and **h2o** packages to do some data mining. I created some pictures about what philosophers said and trained a model which can find synonyms. Note that the synonyms may not be accurate since the model is trained by words said by philosophers.
